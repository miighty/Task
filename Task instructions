You are required to ensure that the code can run on an emulator, or physical device. 
1.	The application uses fragments and Viewpager which changes the screen every time the user swipes to the left or the right.
Currently every time the user swipes it calls the same fragment. Edit the code to make to make it call all three of the fragments in the program (fragment_main,fragment_main1,fragment_main2).
2.	Secondly create your own fragment and then include it into the swipe sequence so the user can now swipe four times.
